      <h5>Please Read These Terms and Conditions Carefully</h5>

      <p>You must be 18 or over to accept these Terms and download the App and be legally permitted to use the App enforced by the laws of your domiciled country. You can terminate your account with Pear at any time. The procedure is really simple, and all you have to do is to click “Delete Account” in the settings page of the App. We may end your rights to use our App at any time without notice. If you have paid for Premium Services, no refund will be made.</p>
      <h5>3. Purchases</h5>
      <p>The App may offer additional products, services and enhancements for purchase through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other mobile or web application platforms or storefronts authorized by us (each, a “Third Party Store”). If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with the Third Party Store you are using (e.g., Android, Apple, etc.) (“your Mobile Platform Account”), and your Mobile Platform Account will be charged for the In-App Purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as well as the general terms applicable to all other in-app purchases made through your Mobile Platform Account (e.g., Android, Apple, etc.).</p>
      <p>In-App Purchases may include one-time purchases as well as monthly subscriptions (e.g., a one-month subscription, three-month subscription, six-month subscription, etc.) to additional account features. At the end of the free trial period (if any), you will be charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. Please note that for In-App Purchases made on a subscription basis, your subscription will automatically renew for the same subscription period as you initially purchased (e.g., if you made an In-App Purchase for a six-month subscription, your subscription will be automatically renewed for an additional six-months). To avoid any charges for additional periods, you must cancel before the end of the free trial period, subscription period or renewal, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of your Mobile Platform Account. Please note that you will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel in accordance with your Mobile Platform Account’s terms. In all cases, we are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever for any payment processing errors or fees or other service-related issues, including those issues that may arise from inaccurate account information, or products or goods you obtain through such Third-Party Stores. We encourage you to review the terms and conditions of the applicable Third Party Store before you make any In-App Purchases.</p>
      <p>From time to time we may automatically update the App to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively, we may ask you to update the App for these reasons. If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App.</p>
      <p>We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of the App is delayed or interrupted by an event outside our control, then we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay but we are not liable for them and we do not provide refunds for Services you have paid for but not received.</p>
