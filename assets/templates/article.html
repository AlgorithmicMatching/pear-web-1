    <h1>A Women's Lecture Series in Brooklyn</h1>
    <div class="row flex--justify-center">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
        <p>Every week, I attend a lecture with about 30 women. One of the women will share her personal story regarding her journey of faith.</p>
        <p>We call it the 'Women of Faith Lecture Series'. I actually started this a couple of years ago when I got assigned to be the Activities Director for this group of women. It turns out I really didn't want to be the Activities Director. I envisioned myself schlepping pots of chili for a cook-off. Or gathering women together to make something crafty. And well, you may have gathered by now that I just don't do crafts. I seldom cook anymore, either.</p>
        <p>And so, I thought and thought about changing up the way these activities were always done. I wanted to do something MEANINGFUL - even life changing! I knew it was possible.</p>

        <p>These women have all learned so much about life, faith, and healing because of these experiences. And I can't tell you how powerful it has been to hear their stories in detail. At the end of the lectures, we have a Q&A with the speaker and a very open discussion about the topic. We've all learned so, so much.</p>
        <p>And so - for anyone out there who may want to start up something like this of their own, I say go for it! I can't recommend it enough. I am guessing the women of your church or community would be THRILLED to be a part of this.</p>
        <p>And - if you're in New York and would like to attend our little lectures in Brooklyn, PLEASE let me know and I'll send you a note about dates. We meet at a church in Carroll Gardens. Of course, women of all faiths are welcome. I'm confident you would love the experience. You see, we all come to these lectures full of love for the speaker. And she comes full of love for us, or she wouldn't be interested in sharing. And so, the feeling there is something else. It's vulnerability at it's best...the kind that leads to greater connection and love.</p>
        <p>Wishing you all a Happy Monday. Let's make it good.</p>
        <p>P.S. I just heard this weekend that two people made a connection and went out on a date because of our blog!!! :) :) We are kind of dying over that. SO great. I've actually been wanting to start a little chat forum where people could discuss all kind of topics related to LOVE. (What do you think of the idea?) And who knows, maybe that could even lead to more connections. </p>
