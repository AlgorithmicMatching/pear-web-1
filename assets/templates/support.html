				Let’s say you are showed Charlie and Jessie. When you click on the Pear icon in Jessie’s pic, you are telling us that you like Jessie more than Charlie. By asking you to perform more comparisons, we can figure out who you like more from who you like less. The more you compare, the more we learn about you, the more your matches improve. So keep comparing!
